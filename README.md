# 7785_final_project

The most important thing is that the filepaths line up and the newLabels.csv is used instead of the existing labels. We changed the existing labels to match with...
0: Wall
1: Straight Left
2: Curved Left
3: Stright Right
4: Curved right
5: Stop
6: Turn Around
7: Goal

With the correct labels and filepaths to the images you should be able to run the code. It will print out a bunch of numbers before finishing with accuracy and the confusion matrix.
